# Call for Papers

We solicit papers in areas including (but not limited to):

• Dataset Auditing and Bias Discovery - Detecting unauthorized use of artworks in training data and
evaluating them for demographic or cultural biases.

• Style Mimicry and Protection - Metrics for measuring “style similarity” and identity leakage and
technical defenses against unauthorized style transfer

• Forensics and Provenance - Watermarking, fingerprinting, and AI-based methods for tracing gener-
ated images back to training samples

• Legal and Ethical Dimensions - Copyright, derivative works, and substantial similarity tests for AI
art in international frameworks, moral rights, creative misuse, and artist attribution

• Human–AI Collaboration - Human–AI co-creativity in visual art and user perception studies: au-
thenticity, trust, and cultural reception

• Societal and Policy Impact - Implications for creative industries, museums, and digital marketplaces;
Responsible licensing, compensation models, and collective rights management

Submissions can include short papers (up to 4 pages including references) or full papers (up to 8 pages
excluding references) in the WACV main conference format. Accepted full papers will be included in the
WACV proceedings. When deciding whether a submission should be a short paper or a full paper, please
consider the significance and novelty of the contributions. If the proposed approach is well-developed with
sufficient theoretical and/or empirical justification, consider submitting a full paper. If the work is a simple
extension or summary of published work in other venues or is in the proof-of-concept stage, a short paper
will provide a good basis for discussion and feedback. We welcome papers that propose a new technical
approach for any of the above, or claim to take a position regarding challenging and open-ended questions
at the intersection of AI and Ethics in the Visual Art domain.
